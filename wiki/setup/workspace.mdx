title: Create you workspace
---
You are going to learn **how to use** the methods discussed before to create your own workspace!

<Callout variant="warning">
    It is **highly suggested** to go over the "theory" first, and read the **"Understanding the library"** folder at least once.
    You are going to use **methods** explained in there, and things will be **taken for granted**!
</Callout>

In your **event** class, inside the **onRenderHealth(...)** method, use the **shouldRenderHealthBar(...)** to create your workspace:


<CodeTabs>
```js !!tabs ModEvents.class
@EventBusSubscriber(modid = YouMod.MOD_ID, bus = EventBusSubscriber.Bus.GAME, value =  Dist.CLIENT)
public class ModClientEvents {

    @SubscribeEvent
    public static void onRenderHealth(RenderGuiLayerEvent.Pre event) {

        HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.shouldRenderHealthBar(event, livingEntity -> {

        });

    }

}


```
</CodeTabs>

Perfect, now set up the **renderHealthBar(...)** method, like this:


<CodeTabs>
```js !!tabs ModEvents.class

        HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.shouldRenderHealthBar(event, livingEntity -> {

            HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.renderHealthBar(event);
        });


```
</CodeTabs>

In this stage, if you were to **run** the game the health bar will look **exactly** as the **vanilla** version.


Now let's use some **manipulation methods** to **customize** the health bar:

<CodeTabs>
```js !!tabs ModEvents.class

        HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.shouldRenderHealthBar(event, livingEntity -> {
            HealthComponent.setWitheredType(HealthTypes.ModdedTextures.BLUE_HEARTS);
            HealthComponent.setRegenAnimationSpeed(2);
            HealthComponent.setRegenAnimationOffSetY(-1);


            HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.renderHealthBar(event);
        });

```
</CodeTabs>

This way you are changing the look of the **withered heart** (so if the player has the **wither effect**, instead of the normal withered heart,
the CustomHeartType **BLUE_HEARTS** will be displayed). Then the **animation** of the regeneration is **slowed down**
(vanilla is 1 tick per heart, here you are putting 2 ticks per hearts), and the amount the **hearts will lift** due to the
regen effect is **reduced** (vanilla is -2, you are putting -1, so the heart will lift less).
You can now **try** this setup!

## Why don't I put a restriction? **Ifs and restrictions**
Let's now try to put a **restriction** to this rendering. For example, this setup should **only be applied** if the player is **underwater**! Here is an example:


<CodeTabs>
```js !!tabs ModEvents.class

            if (livingEntity.isInWater()) {
                HealthComponent.setWitheredType(HealthTypes.ModdedTextures.BLUE_HEARTS);
                HealthComponent.setRegenAnimationSpeed(2);
                HealthComponent.setRegenAnimationOffSetY(-1);


                HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.renderHealthBar(event);
            }

```
</CodeTabs>

This way the custom health bar with weird withered hearts and strange regeneration animation will **only be rendered** when the player is in Water!


<Callout variant="info">
    It is suggested to put the **renderHealthBar(...)** method inside the **restrictions** you put, this way the health bar will only be overridden and re-rendered
    only when **necessary**, without wasting pc resources!
</Callout>

## Can I use a CustomHeartType as hearts texture? **Custom Heart and Container Type**
Obusly it is possible to use custom heart types as well as custom container types, as long as you register correctly (check out the guide on the )
