You are going to learn how to use the methods discussed before to create your own workspace!

<Callout variant="warning">
    It is **highly suggested** to go over the "theory" first, and read the **"Understanding the library"** folder at least once.
    You are going to use **methods** explained in there, and thing will be **taken for granted**!
