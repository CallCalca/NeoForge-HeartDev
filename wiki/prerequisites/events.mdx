## Prerequisites
This API exploits a Minecraft client side event to override the rendering of the health bar. You must therefore create a special class to handle client-side events.

So in your event class u sould have this kind of code:

```
@EventBusSubscriber(modid = YourMod.MOD_ID, bus = EventBusSubscriber.Bus.GAME, value =  Dist.CLIENT)
public class ModClientEvents {

}
```
When you have this class working, you need to access the rendering event, writing something like this:

```
    @SubscribeEvent
    public static void onRenderHealth(RenderGuiLayerEvent.Pre event) {

    }
```
<pre> ```java public class MyMod { public void init() { System.out.println("Hello, Minecraft!"); } } ``` </pre>

At the end you should have something like this:

```
@EventBusSubscriber(modid = YouMod.MOD_ID, bus = EventBusSubscriber.Bus.GAME, value =  Dist.CLIENT)
public class ModClientEvents {

    @SubscribeEvent
    public static void onRenderHealth(RenderGuiLayerEvent.Pre event) {

    }

}
```
