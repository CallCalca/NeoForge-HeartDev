## Prerequisites
This API exploits a Minecraft **client side** event to override the rendering of the health bar. You must therefore create a special class to handle client-side events.

So you should create a class similar to this:

<CodeTabs>

```js !!tabs ModEvents.class
@EventBusSubscriber(modid = YourMod.MOD_ID, bus = EventBusSubscriber.Bus.GAME, value =  Dist.CLIENT)
public class ModClientEvents {

}
```

</CodeTabs>

When you have this class working, you need to access the rendering event, using this Minecraft event handler:


<CodeTabs>

```js !!tabs ModEvents.class
// the event -> RenderGuiLayerEvent.Pre

    @SubscribeEvent
    public static void onRenderHealth(RenderGuiLayerEvent.Pre event) {

    }
```

</CodeTabs>


At the end you should have something like this:

<CodeTabs>

```js !!tabs ModEvents.class
@EventBusSubscriber(modid = YouMod.MOD_ID, bus = EventBusSubscriber.Bus.GAME, value =  Dist.CLIENT)
public class ModClientEvents {

    @SubscribeEvent
    public static void onRenderHealth(RenderGuiLayerEvent.Pre event) {

    }

}
```

</CodeTabs>

<Callout variant="info">
    You don't need to use a system exactly like this one, as long as you can properly access the **RenderGuiLayerEvent.Pre** event
</Callout>

At this **point** you can continue with the set up of the library.
