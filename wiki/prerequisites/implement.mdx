title: Implementation
---

To implement this library you need to access your **build.gradle** file in your mod project, and go in the first **"repositories"** section you find.
In here you need to insert this code:

<CodeTabs>

```js !!tabs build.gradle

repositories {
    maven { url = "https://api.modrinth.com/maven" } // insert this!
}


```

</CodeTabs>

Then in you **"dependencies"** section add this code:

<CodeTabs>

```js !!tabs build.gradle

dependencies {
    implementation("maven.modrinth:heartdev:-version-") //HeartDev implementation!
}


```

</CodeTabs>
In -version- put the **last version** available of the library! (for example -version- = 1.1.0-neoforge21.0-21.1)


**That's it!** Just reload your project and a **download** of the resources should start!
