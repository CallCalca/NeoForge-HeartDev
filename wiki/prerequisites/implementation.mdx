Then in you "dependencies" section add this code:

<CodeTabs>

```js !!tabs build.gradle


dependencies {
    implementation("maven.modrinth:heartdev:<Version>") //HeartDev implementation!
}


```

</CodeTabs>
In <Version> put the last version available of the library! (for example <Version> = 1.0.5)


That's it! Just reload your project and the download should start!
