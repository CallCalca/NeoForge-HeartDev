title: Implementation
---

To implement this mod you need to access your build.gradle file in your mod project, and go in the first "repositories" section you find.
In here you need to insert this code:

<CodeTabs>

```js !!tabs build.gradle


repositories {
    maven { url = "https://api.modrinth.com/maven" } // insert this!
}


```

</CodeTabs>

Then in you "dependencies" section add this code:

<CodeTabs>

```js !!tabs build.gradle


dependencies {
    implementation("maven.modrinth:heartdev:<Version>") //HeartDev implementation!
}


```

</CodeTabs>
In <Version> put the last version available of the library! (for example <Version> = 1.0.5)


That's it! Just reload your project and the download should start!
