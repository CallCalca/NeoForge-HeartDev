## Understanding the library
This library offers different tools to customize the health bar look and behaviour.
First, let's divide the available tools according to their task:
- **Rendering methods** : placed in the _**HealthBar**_ class, they take care of the rendering itself.
- **Manipulation methods** : these methods, stored in the _**HealthComponent**_ class, provide access to textures and behaviors.
- **Creation methods** : these methods can be found in the _**HealthTypes**_ class and allow the creation of new HeartTypes (containers with all the different states a heart can take, such as full, half, blinking, etc...).

### Rendering methods
In the HealthBar class, the first thing to understand is **"how do i access the methods?"** To access the methods you need to use the _**HEALTH_INSTANCE**_ provided by the same class. Like this:

```
HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE

HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.<theMethod()>;
```

The first method that should be used, is **_shouldRenderHealthBar(...)_**. This controls whether the rendering event is the event that renders health: if you were to use the RenderGuiLayerEvent.Pre event exactly as it is, you would be going to take action on everything that is rendered in a player's screen. This method allows you to **access and modify only that particular instance that is responsible for rendering hearts**.
So, this should be **the first method to be used** and should be used, within onRenderHealth(...) of the class first created, like this:

```
HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.shouldRenderHealthBar(event, livingEntity -> {
            //This is you workspace
});
//not this
```
