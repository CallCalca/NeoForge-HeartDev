Creation methods are the ones responsible for the creation of new resources and textures. These are located in the
**HealthTypes** class.

## How do I create a new Heart Type? **createCustomHeartType(...)**
To create a new heart type (or better, a new CustomHeartType), you can start by creating a new class to store the new resources.
At this point you should use the **createCustomHeartType(...)** method, but what does it do? And how should I use it?


<CodeTabs>
```js !!tabs ModResources.class

    CustomHeartType CUSTOM_HEART = HealthTypes.createCustomHeartType(YouMod.MOD_ID, "nameOfTheHeart");


```
</CodeTabs>

This is how you use the method, putting as parameter you MOD_ID and the name of the heart. The name of the heart is extremely important, and,
based on what you put, your textures may be seen or not. The createCustomHeartType(...) methods point to 8 different textures this being:
|| Let's call "nameOfTheHeart" -> "name"
- "name" + "_full.png": pointing to the **full** heart texture;
- "name" + "_half.png": pointing to the **half** heart texture;
- "name" + "_full_blinking.png": pointing to the **full blinking** heart texture;
- "name" + "_half_blinking.png": pointing to the **half blinking** texture;
- "name" + "_hardcore_full.png": pointing to the **hardcore full** heart texture;
- "name" + "_hardcore_half.png": pointing to the **hardcore half** heart texture;
- "name" + "_hardcore_full_blinking.png": pointing to the **hardcore full blinking** texture;
- "name" + "_hardcore_half_blinking.png": pointing to the **hardcore half blinking** texture;

This is how you should **rename** your textures. If, for instance, my heart textures are orange_full, orange_half... then the "nameOfTheHeart" would be **"orange"**.
Also, your textures should be place in a specific path inside you project:
- resources/**assets**/modid/**textures**/gui/**sprites**/hud/**heart**/texture.png
