title: Creation Methods

Creation methods are the ones responsible for the creation of new resources and textures. These are located in the
**HealthTypes** class.

## How do I create a new Heart Type? **createCustomHeartType(...)**
To create a new heart type (or better, a new CustomHeartType), you can start by creating a new class to store the new resources.
At this point you should use the **createCustomHeartType(...)** method, but what does it do? And how should I use it?


<CodeTabs>
```js !!tabs ModResources.class

    CustomHeartType CUSTOM_HEART = HealthTypes.createCustomHeartType(YouMod.MOD_ID, "nameOfTheHeart");


```
</CodeTabs>

This is how you use the method, putting as parameter you MOD_ID and the name of the heart. The name of the heart is extremely important, and,
based on what you put, your textures may be seen or not. The createCustomHeartType(...) methods point to 8 different textures this being:
|| Let's call "nameOfTheHeart" -> "name"
1. "name" + "_full.png": pointing to the **full** heart texture;
2. "name" + "_half.png": pointing to the **half** heart texture;
3. "name" + "_full_blinking.png": pointing to the **full blinking** heart texture;
4. "name" + "_half_blinking.png": pointing to the **half blinking** texture;
5. "name" + "_hardcore_full.png": pointing to the **hardcore full** heart texture;
6. "name" + "_hardcore_half.png": pointing to the **hardcore half** heart texture;
7. "name" + "_hardcore_full_blinking.png": pointing to the **hardcore full blinking** texture;
8. "name" + "_hardcore_half_blinking.png": pointing to the **hardcore half blinking** texture;

This is how you should **rename** your textures. If, for instance, my heart textures are orange_full, orange_half... then the "nameOfTheHeart" would be **"orange"**.
Also, your textures should be place in a specific path inside you project:

## How do I create a new Container Type? **createNORMALCustomContainerType(...)** and **createCOMPLEXCustomContainerType(...)**
Since container don't need an half variant of the textures, and can accept two different blinking textures
(one for damage blinking, and the other for regen blinking), you use different methods.
To generate a CustomContainerType with the **same** damage and regen **blinking textures**, you should use the **createNORMALCustomContainerType(...)** method.
Instead, to separate the two textures, use the **createCOMPLEXCustomContainerType(...)** method.

Here is how they operate:


**createNORMALCustomContainerType(...)**

1. "name" + "_container.png": pointing to the **container** texture;
2. "name" + "_container_blinking.png": pointing to the **container blinking** texture;
3. "name" + "_container_blinking.png": pointing to the **container blinking** texture;
4. "name" + "_container_hardcore.png": pointing to the **container hardcore** texture;
5. "name" + "_container_hardcore_blinking.png": pointing to the **container hardcore blinking** texture;
6. "name" + "_container_hardcore_blinking.png": pointing to the **container hardcore blinking** texture;
As you can see, the blinking textures have the same path.

**createCOMPLEXCustomContainerType(...)**

1. "name" + "_container.png": pointing to the **container** texture;
2. "name" + "_container_blinking_damage.png": pointing to the **container blinking damage** texture;
3. "name" + "_container_blinking_healing.png": pointing to the **container blinking healing** texture;
4. "name" + "_container_hardcore.png": pointing to the **container hardcore** texture;
5. "name" + "_container_hardcore_blinking_damage.png": pointing to the **container hardcore blinking damage** texture;
6. "name" + "_container_hardcore_blinking_healing.png": pointing to the **container hardcore blinking healing** texture;
This time the damage blinking and the regen blinking have different path.


<Callout variant="warning">
    The textures should be place in the same exact path: resources/**assets**/modid/**textures**/gui/**sprites**/hud/**heart**/texture.png

    Also you should always name you textures based on the method you use.
