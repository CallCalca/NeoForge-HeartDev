title: Rendering Methods
---

Rendering methods are responsible, as the name suggest, for **rendering** the health bar. These are located inside the
**HealthBar** class.

## Accessing the methods
----

The HealthBar class provides an instance that is used to access the methods. To access the methods, then
you need to use the _**HEALTH_INSTANCE**_ provided by the same class, otherwise the methods won't appear, like this:


<CodeTabs>
```js !!tabs Correct
// use this --> HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE

    HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.method();


```

```js !!tabs Incorrect
// DONT DO THIS /!\

    HealthBar.method(); //It won't work!


```
</CodeTabs>


## When should my health bar be overridden? **shouldRenderHealthBar(...)**
----

The first method to understand is **_shouldRenderHealthBar(...)_**. It controls whether the rendering event is actually
rendering the health bar or not: if you were to use the RenderGuiLayerEvent.Pre event exactly as it is, you are
taking action on everything that is rendered in a player's screen. This method allows you to access and modify
only that **particular instance** that is responsible for rendering hearts.

It is provided with a runnable component, allowing all other methods to be put inside the **lambda expression**.

<CodeTabs>
```js !!tabs ModEvents.class (in your onRenderHealth() event)

HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.shouldRenderHealthBar(event, livingEntity -> {
            //Activating only if the event is rendering the hearts
            //This is you workspace!
});
    //Not this /!\

    //Any methods called outside the "control" method will activated
        //no metter if the event is rendering the health bar or not!
```
</CodeTabs>

As you can see this method provides a **livingEntity** instance that can be used to check all sort of thing **about a player**
(does he has any effects? is he taking damage?...) and also allows to access the **level** using the same entity variable (livingEntity.level)


## How do I render my custom health bar? **renderHealthBar(...)**
----

The renderHealthBar(...) method is responsible for the **overriding** and **rendering** of the health bar.
It presents in two different ways, the first requiring only 1 parameter (being a RenderGuiLayerEvent.Pre, so the "event"),
and the other one requiring 2 parameter being the RenderGuiLayerEvent.Pre, and another lambda expression.

The lambda expression is necessary to **override** certain elements through the **manipulation methods**.


<Callout variant="info">
    To know more about **manipulation methods** check out the dedicated page.
</Callout>

<CodeTabs>
```js !!tabs Simple method

    HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.renderHealthBar(event);


```
```js !!tabs Complex method

    HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.renderHealthBar(event, () -> {
            //The manipulation methods
    });


```
</CodeTabs>

This method operates in multiple steps:
1. **Aborting**: the method cancels the event, interrupting the rendering of the health bar (int this phase, the health bar is no longer rendered);
2. **Building resources**: variables are registered, textures are initialized and player and world data are stored.
3. **Rendering**: hearts are rendered following a particular order: first the **absorption** hearts are rendered, followed by the **containers** (the empty hearts),
then the **blinking** hearts (the ones that appear when taking damage) and, at the end, the **normal** hearts (half and full red hearts).
4. **Fix and reset**: finally the y start point of the armor bar is realigned to its normal value, and some variables get reset.

This list can come in handy when trying to understand the manipulation methods.


<Callout variant="warning">
    There must be **only** 1 renderHealthBar(...) method **running** at a time! Otherwise **multiple** health bar will be shown!
</Callout>

## What are these effects? **PreSets.PRESETS_INSTANCE**

----

Inside the HealthBar class, there's a subclass called **PreSets**. In here you can find some methods (accessible with the **PRESETS_INSTANCE**),
responsible for the activation of the heart effects.
These methods **will not do anything alone**, but need to be pared with the renderHealthBar(...) method:

<CodeTabs>
```js !!tabs Access
// access -> HealthBar.PreSets.PRESETS_ISTANCE.method();

        HealthBar.PreSets.PRESETS_ISTANCE.activateLightBlueEffect();


```
```js !!tabs Complete use

    HealthBar.PreSets.PRESETS_ISTANCE.activateLightBlueEffect();

    HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.renderHealthBar(event);


```
</CodeTabs>

Once an effect is activated, it will **change** the texture of the hearts once applied. Having multiple effects applied at the
same time will result in **only one** being shown, and that is the **last event activated** in you code:

<CodeTabs>
```js !!tabs Priority

        HealthBar.PreSets.PRESETS_ISTANCE.activateLightBlueEffect();
        HealthBar.PreSets.PRESETS_ISTANCE.activateOrangeEffect();
        HealthBar.PreSets.PRESETS_ISTANCE.activateYellowEffect();
        //Last effect will have priority in case of multiple effects present at the same time
        //Green hearts will have the priority
        HealthBar.PreSets.PRESETS_ISTANCE.activateGreenEffect();


```
</CodeTabs>

<Callout variant="info">
    These activation methods simply set a variable responsible for the resource building (phase 2 of the renderHealthBar(...) method)
    which will then be used to set the textures of the hearts. It doesn't render anything, it just sets variables then will be used from the render
    method.
