title: Manipulation Methods
---

Manipulation methods can be used to set or override textures and behaviour of the health bar. These are stored
int the HealthComponent class, can be accessed simply by calling the class (HealthComponent.method(...))

## But how do I use them? **Set methods, and Override methods**
----

So, These methods can be divided in two big groups: the "Set" methods and the "Override" methods (distinguishable by their name), They operates in different
ways, and so they need different application.

Let's suppose you created your workspace and it looks something like this:

<CodeTabs>
```js !!tabs ModEvents.class (in your onRenderHealth() event)

HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.shouldRenderHealthBar(event, livingEntity -> {

    HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.renderHealthBar(event, () -> {

    });

});
```
</CodeTabs>

You can divide your workspace in two parts:

<CodeTabs>
```js !!tabs ModEvents.class (in your onRenderHealth() event)

HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.shouldRenderHealthBar(event, livingEntity -> {
        //Manipulation methods
            //Set methods
    HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.renderHealthBar(event, () -> {
        //Manipulation methods
            //Override methods
    });

});
```
</CodeTabs>

As you can see "Set" methods are placed under the shouldRenderHealthBar(...) and, obviously, before the renderHealthBar(...) method. "Override" method,
on the other hand, are placed inside the lambda of the renderHealthBar method...
But why that?

### Set methods
These methods operates by setting the value of certain variables that will then be used on phase 2 of the renderHealthBar(...) methods.
They are used before the same method, because they can cast the value of the variables BEFORE they are used, so all resources will build in consequence.

### Override methods
These methods instead operates **overriding** variables that are assigned to a value in between phases and **can't therefore
be accessed** before the renderHealthBar(...).
Immagine this method as if it casted an **int** variable to 12. Event if you used an override method **before**,
to set the variable to 8, it will then be **re-assigned**to 12. This is why these methods need to be used **'inside'**
the method, in between phases (generally right before the rendering of the health bar phase),
so that same variable will be still set to 12, but you override its value to 8 right before it is used for rendering!
