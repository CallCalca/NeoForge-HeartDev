title: Manipulation Methods
---

Manipulation methods can be used to set or override textures and behaviour of the health bar. These are stored
int the HealthComponent class, can be accessed simply by calling the class (HealthComponent.method(...))

## How do I use them? **Set methods, and Override methods**
----

These methods can be divided in two big groups: the "Set" methods and the "Override" methods (distinguishable by their name), They operates in different
ways, and so they need different application.

Let's suppose you created your workspace and it looks something like this:

<CodeTabs>
```js !!tabs ModEvents.class (in your onRenderHealth() event)

HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.shouldRenderHealthBar(event, livingEntity -> {

    HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.renderHealthBar(event, () -> {

    });

});
```
</CodeTabs>

You can divide your workspace in two parts:

<CodeTabs>
```js !!tabs ModEvents.class (in your onRenderHealth() event)

HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.shouldRenderHealthBar(event, livingEntity -> {
        //Manipulation methods
            //Set methods
    HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.renderHealthBar(event, () -> {
        //Manipulation methods
            //Override methods
    });

});
```
</CodeTabs>

As you can see "Set" methods are placed under the shouldRenderHealthBar(...) and, obviously, before the renderHealthBar(...) method. "Override" method,
on the other hand, are placed inside the lambda of the renderHealthBar method...
But why that?

### Set methods
These methods operates by **setting** the value of certain variables that will then be used in phase 2 of the renderHealthBar(...) methods.
They are used before the same method, because they can cast the value of the variables **BEFORE** they are used, so all resources will build in consequence.

### Override methods
These methods instead operates **overriding** variables that are assigned to a value in between phases and **can't therefore
be accessed** before the renderHealthBar(...).
Immagine this method as if it casted an **int** variable to 12. Event if you used an override method **before**,
to set the variable to 8, it will then be **re-assigned** to 12. This is why these methods need to be used **'inside'**
the method, in between phases (generally right before the rendering of the health bar phase),
this way that same variable will be still set to 12, but you **override** its value to 8 **right before** it is used for rendering!


# Methods break down ----
A little break down to better understand the methods.

## What does this method do? **Set methods**
----

- **setContainerType(...)**: set a CustomContainerType that will be used instead if the vanilla one.
- **setHeartType(...)**: set a CustomHeartType that will be used instead if the vanilla normal hearts.
- **setPoisonedType(...)**: set a CustomHeartType that will be used instead if the vanilla poisoned hearts.
- **setWitheredType(...)**: set a CustomHeartType that will be used instead if the vanilla withered hearts.
- **setFrozenType(...)**: set a CustomHeartType that will be used instead if the vanilla frozen hearts.
- **setAbsorbingType(...)**: set a CustomHeartType that will be used instead if the vanilla absorbing hearts.

----

- **setRegenAnimationSpeed(...)**: set for how many ticks a heart should be lifted up when having the regen effect.

Vanilla value: 1 (tick per heart).
- **setRegenAnimationCooldown(...)**: set for how much time the animation rests between (1 cycle is the animation going from start to tge last heart).

Vanilla value: 15 (ticks).
- **setRegenAnimationOffSetY(...)**: set how much the heart should be lifted up.

Vanilla value: -2 (pixels. The heart lifts up by 2 pixels).

## What does this method do? **Override methods**
----

Let's first talk about the methods that overrides the hearts textures. These have a general syntax similar to this:

- "override" + "Type" + "State" + "Blinking" +  "Heart" (...).

This means that in the **name** of the method you know exactly what you are overriding. For example, using this method:

- overrideWitheredHalfHeartBlinking(...).

You will **override** the texture of the **withered** type of heart, but in his **half** form, in its **blinking** form (so the damage blinking).

Instead by using this method:

- overrideFullHeart(...)

You will **override** the texture of the **normal** type of heart (nothing is specified in the Type), in his **full** form, in his **not blinking** form (nothing specified)
