# Rendering methods
## ______________________________________________________________

Rendering methods are responsible, as the name suggest, for rendering the health bar. Thiese are located inside the
**HealthBar** class.

## Accessing the methods
The HealthBar class provides an instance that is used to access the methods. To access the methods, then
you need to use the _**HEALTH_INSTANCE**_ provided by the same class, otherwise the methods won't appear, like this:


<CodeTabs>
```js !!tabs Correct
// use this --> HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE

    HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.method();


```

```js !!tabs Incorrect
// DONT DO THIS /!\

    HealthBar.method(); //It won't work!


```
</CodeTabs>

## When should my healthBar be overridden? **shouldRenderHealthBar(...)**

The first method to understand is **_shouldRenderHealthBar(...)_**. It controls whether the rendering event is actually
rendering the health bar or not: if you were to use the RenderGuiLayerEvent.Pre event exactly as it is, you are
taking action on everything that is rendered in a player's screen. This method allows you to access and modify
only that **particular instance** that is responsible for rendering hearts.

It is provided with a runnable component, allowing all other methods to be put inside the **lambda expression**.

<CodeTabs>
```js !!tabs ModEvents.class (in your onRenderHealth() event)

HealthBar.HEALTH_INSTANCE.shouldRenderHealthBar(event, livingEntity -> {
            //Activating only if the event is rendering the hearts
            //This is you workspace!
});
    //Not this /!\

    //Any methods called outside the "control" method will activated
        //no metter if the event is rendering the health bar or not!
```
</CodeTabs>

As you can see this method provides a **livingEntity** instance that can be used to check all sort of thing **about a player**
(does he has any effects? is he taking damage?...) and also allows to access the **level** using the same entity variable (livingEntity.level)
